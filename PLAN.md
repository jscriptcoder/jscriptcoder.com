# Plan: JSHACK.ME CTF Terminal Game

## Goal

Build a web-based CTF (Capture The Flag) hacking game where players use a JavaScript terminal to explore a virtual file system, escalate privileges, and hack into remote machines to find 12 hidden flags.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Terminal with JavaScript execution and custom commands
- [x] Virtual Unix-like file system with permissions
- [x] User authentication system (su command with password hashing)
- [x] Network simulation with multiple machines
- [x] Network reconnaissance commands (ifconfig, ping, nmap, nslookup)
- [x] Remote machine access (ssh, ftp, nc)
- [x] Per-machine file systems with unique content
- [x] 12 hidden flags with guided progression across 5 machines
- [x] Command restrictions by user type (guest/user/root tiers)
- [x] Additional exploitation commands (curl, strings, decrypt, output, resolve, exit)
- [x] Session and filesystem persistence (IndexedDB)
- [x] Realistic filesystem noise (configs, logs, dotfiles, red herrings)
- [x] Unit tests (738 tests across 47 files)
- [ ] Victory tracking — flag detection, progress display, completion celebration
- [ ] Challenge variety — additional commands (grep, base64, mysql, etc.)

## Steps

### Step 1: Core terminal with JavaScript execution (Done)

Terminal component with input/output, command history, tab autocompletion, `new Function()` evaluation.

### Step 2: Virtual file system (Done)

Unix-like directory structure with read/write/execute permissions per user type (root/user/guest). FileNode tree with `createFileSystem()` factory.

### Step 3: File system commands (Done)

pwd, ls, cd, cat commands with permission checking. Dotfile filtering (hidden by default, `-a` to show).

### Step 4: User authentication (Done)

su command with MD5 password hashing, /etc/passwd file per machine.

### Step 5: Network infrastructure (Done)

NetworkContext with interfaces, remote machines (gateway, fileserver, webserver, darknet), DNS records.

### Step 6: Network commands (Done)

ifconfig, ping (async), nmap (async), nslookup (async) — all use AsyncOutput streaming pattern.

### Step 7: Remote access — SSH (Done)

ssh command with async connection, password authentication, session stack (pushSession/popSession). exit command to return.

### Step 8: Place flags in file system (Done)

12 flags across 5 machines with guided progression. Flag files, encrypted files (AES-256-GCM), binary files for strings.

### Step 9: Add hints and breadcrumbs (Done)

Credential chain: log files, config files, web pages leak passwords for next machine. Each flag hints at the next.

### Step 10: Remote machine file systems (Done)

Per-machine filesystems via `machineFileSystems.ts`. FileSystemContext stores ALL machine filesystems in state. Cross-machine methods for FTP/curl.

### Step 11: Additional exploitation commands (Done)

- **ftp** — FTP mode with dedicated command set (pwd, lpwd, cd, lcd, ls, lls, get, put, quit/bye)
- **nc** — Netcat with interactive backdoor mode (read-only shell as service owner)
- **curl** — HTTP client with GET/POST, DNS resolution, per-machine server config
- **decrypt** — AES-256-GCM decryption via Web Crypto API (root only)
- **strings** — Extract printable strings from binary files
- **output** — Capture command output to variable or file
- **resolve** — Unwrap Promises and display resolved value
- **exit** — Close SSH/NC connection and return to previous session

### Step 12: Session persistence (Done)

IndexedDB (`jshack-db` database) with pre-load cache pattern. Session state, session stack, FTP/NC sessions persisted. Filesystem patches (user-created/modified files) persisted separately. One-time auto-migration from localStorage.

### Step 13: Victory tracking (Next)

- **Flag detection**: Scan command output for `FLAG{...}` pattern (cat, curl, strings, decrypt, etc.)
- **Storage**: Persist found flags to IndexedDB (flag name, timestamp)
- **Notification**: Box-drawing banner on new flag capture with progress (e.g., "3/12 flags found")
- **flags() command**: Check progress anytime — list found flags and total progress
- **Victory screen**: ASCII art celebration when all 12 flags found

### Step 14: Challenge variety (Future)

Additional commands and multi-step puzzle types: grep, base64, env, mysql, checksum, hmac.

## Test Coverage

738 tests across 47 colocated test files:

- All commands with logic are tested (factory pattern with mock context injection)
- FTP subcommands tested (cd, lcd, ls, lls, get, put)
- NC command and subcommands tested (nc, cat, cd, ls)
- curl tested (27 tests: errors, GET, POST, headers, DNS, async)
- decrypt tested (17 tests), output (16), resolve (14), strings (12)
- Permissions module tested (21 tests)
- Async commands tested with fake timers
- React hooks tested (useCommandHistory, useVariables, useAutoComplete)
- React components tested (TerminalOutput, TerminalInput)
- IndexedDB persistence tested (storage wrapper: 14, cache/migration: 14)

## Future Ideas

### Procedurally Generated Missions

Seeded random network generation for replayable missions. Mission types: hidden flag hunt, lateral movement, data exfiltration, privilege escalation chain, time-limited breach. See CTF_DESIGN.md for full design.

### User-Generated Content

Allow players to create and share missions via seed codes. Community voting, ratings, weekly challenges.

### Backend Integration

Mission catalog API, player accounts, leaderboards. Options: Supabase, Firebase, or self-hosted.
