# JscriptCoder

A web-based JavaScript terminal emulator with a retro amber-on-black CRT aesthetic. Execute JavaScript expressions and custom commands in a terminal-like interface, featuring a virtual Unix-like file system and network simulation for CTF-style hacking puzzles.

**Live Demo:** [jscriptcoder.com](https://jscriptcoder.com)

## The Challenge

You start as a regular user on a machine connected to a network. Hidden throughout the system are **flags** - secret strings in the format `FLAG{...}` that prove you've successfully completed a challenge.

Your mission:

- **Explore** the local file system for clues
- **Escalate privileges** to access restricted areas
- **Discover** other machines on the network
- **Hack** your way into remote systems
- **Find all the flags**

Some flags are hidden in plain sight. Others require cracking passwords, exploiting misconfigurations, or pivoting through multiple machines. Use your knowledge of Linux commands, networking, and creative thinking to uncover them all.

Start with `help()` to see available commands. Good luck, hacker.

## Features

- **JavaScript Execution** - Run any JavaScript expression directly in the terminal
- **Command History** - Navigate previous commands with up/down arrows
- **Tab Autocompletion** - Complete commands and variables with Tab key
- **Variable Support** - Create variables with `const` and `let` declarations
- **Virtual Environment** - Explore a simulated system with secrets to uncover
- **Command Restrictions** - Commands are tiered by privilege level; escalate from guest to root to unlock tools
- **Network Simulation** - Discover and hack into remote machines
- **Session Persistence** - Your location and files are saved; return where you left off after refresh
- **SEO & Social Sharing** - Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for rich link previews
- **Retro CRT Theme** - Classic amber-on-black terminal aesthetic

## Network Simulation

Your machine is connected to a local network. You're not alone - there are other machines out there, each running different services and hiding their own secrets.

Use network reconnaissance commands to:

- Discover your network configuration
- Find other machines on the network
- Identify running services and open ports
- Connect to remote systems
- Pivot through machines to reach hidden networks

Each machine has its own network view - interfaces, reachable hosts, and DNS change based on where you are. The deeper you go, the more you discover.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev           # Start development server
npm run build         # Production build
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
npm run format        # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check  # Check formatting (CI)
npm run preview       # Preview production build
npm test              # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run      # Run tests once
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:e2e      # Run Playwright E2E test (full CTF playthrough)
```

### Test Coverage

720 unit tests across 45 colocated test files covering terminal commands, hooks, components, utilities, filesystem, and persistence.

1 Playwright E2E test that plays through the entire CTF game (all 16 flags) in a real browser — serves as both a comprehensive regression test and a visual demo. Run with `--headed` to watch it play:

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

## SEO & Social Sharing

The site includes Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for rich social media previews when sharing the URL. The OG image features the CRT terminal aesthetic with a simulated network scan.

To regenerate the OG image after edits to `public/og-image.html`:

```bash
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size="1200,630" --full-page public/og-image.html public/og-image.png
