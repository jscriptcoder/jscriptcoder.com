      'I\'m Francisco Ramos, a fullstack engineer with 20+ years in the game. ' +
        'Started out building websites back in the early 2000s and never really stopped. I\'ve worked across the entire stack, ' +
        'from frontend and backend to DevOps, picking up whatever tools got the job done.',
      'Along the way I got really into Machine Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning, ' +
        'teaching machines to teach themselves, basically. Built some fun stuff there, from AI training environments to ' +
        'neural network experiments. My Github is full of ML projects if you want to check them out.',
      'Then I went down the Web3 rabbit hole, building DEX aggregators, smart contract tools, ' +
        'and dApps with Solidity. Blockchain was a wild ride.',
      'These days my biggest passion is cybersecurity, especially web security. At my current job I helped uncover ' +
        'several security vulnerabilities, which really got me hooked. I earned a Nanodegree as Security Engineer from Udacity, ' +
        'I\'m grinding through TryHackMe rooms and Portswigger labs whenever I get the chance, and currently working towards my Burp Suite certification.',
      'This little CTF terminal is where all those worlds collide, code, hacking, and the love of breaking things, ' +
        'responsibly of course. Hack away! 😉',
