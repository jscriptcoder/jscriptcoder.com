# Hooks

Custom React hooks that wire together commands, context, and terminal features. These are the glue between the UI (Terminal component) and the domain logic (commands, filesystem, network, session).

## Files

| File                       | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useCommands.ts`           | Master command registry — combines all command sources into a single execution context and command name list                        |
| `useFileSystemCommands.ts` | Creates filesystem commands (pwd, ls, cd, cat, whoami, decrypt, output, strings) with context from `useFileSystem` and `useSession` |
| `useNetworkCommands.ts`    | Creates network commands (ifconfig, ping, nmap, nslookup, ssh, curl, ftp, nc) with context from `useNetwork` and `useFileSystem`    |
| `useFtpCommands.ts`        | Creates FTP-mode commands (pwd, lpwd, cd, lcd, ls, lls, get, put, quit/bye) — returns `null` when not in FTP mode                   |
| `useNcCommands.ts`         | Creates NC-mode commands (pwd, cd, ls, cat, whoami, help, exit) — returns `null` when not in NC mode                                |
| `useCommandHistory.ts`     | Up/down arrow navigation through previous commands                                                                                  |
| `useAutoComplete.ts`       | Tab completion for command names and variable names                                                                                 |
| `useVariables.ts`          | `const`/`let` variable declarations, reassignment, and immutability enforcement                                                     |

## How Commands Are Assembled

`useCommands` is the top-level hook consumed by `Terminal.tsx`. It merges commands from multiple sources:

```
useCommands()
├── Static commands (echo, author, clear, exit, resolve)
├── useFileSystemCommands() → pwd, ls, cd, cat, whoami, decrypt, output, strings
├── useNetworkCommands()    → ifconfig, ping, nmap, nslookup, ssh, curl, ftp, nc
├── su (depends on current machine's user list)
└── help, man (created last, with access to all commands above)
```

After assembly, commands are filtered through `permissions.ts`:

- Restricted commands get their `fn` wrapped with a permission check (throws `permission denied` error)
- `commandNames` is filtered to only accessible commands (for tab autocomplete)
- `help()` receives only accessible commands; `man()` receives all commands

Returns `{ executionContext, commandNames }` where:

- `executionContext` — `Record<string, Function>` injected into `new Function()` for evaluation (with restrictions applied)
- `commandNames` — list of accessible names for tab autocompletion

## Mode-Specific Hooks

`useFtpCommands` and `useNcCommands` return `Map<string, Command> | null`. When active (non-null), `Terminal.tsx` swaps out the normal command set for the mode-specific one.

## Input Hooks

| Hook                | Used By        | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useCommandHistory` | `Terminal.tsx` | Tracks command history array and current index; `navigateUp()`/`navigateDown()` return the command string       |
| `useAutoComplete`   | `Terminal.tsx` | Takes command names + variable names; `getCompletions(input)` returns matches with display text                 |
| `useVariables`      | `Terminal.tsx` | Intercepts `const`/`let`/reassignment before command execution; manages variable store with immutability checks |
